### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The challenge I encountered while building the first part of this app was trying to 
resolve this error:
    Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value
This error was displaying on line 44 in my ViewController file which at the time was this:
    let posterPath = movie["[poster_path]"] as! String
I resolved this error by removing the internal square brackets around poster_path 
with the new line being:
    let posterPath = movie["poster_path"] as! String
I believe this error arose from accidentally pressing the square bracket button again after inserting the quotation marks.
